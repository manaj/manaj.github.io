				<h1>Product Recommendation suite - Self service widgets</h1>
				<h2 class="subheading">
					The challenge was to modernize the outdated Optimizely
					Recommendation software by improving its UX and usability to
					transition it from a managed solution to a self-service
					platform, beginning with its widget management.
				</h2>
				<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Optimizely Recommendation is a product, a part of its
					personalization offering. This software was brought back in
					2016 when Optimizely acquired Peerius.
				</p>
				<p>
					Problem was the software looked a bit old and it had never
					been updated and mostly was a managed solution. We wanted to
					fix the UX and usability problems of the software so it no
					longer needed to be managed and become self service.
				</p>
				<p>
					We started with a small but important part of the app, its
					widget management.

				<h3 id="#team">Team</h3>
				<p>
					Our product recommendation team is multinational and
					geographically diverse, with me as the product designer
					based in Dhaka, our PM in the USA, and the development team
					in Vietnam.
				</p>

				<h3 id="discover">Discover & Define</h3>
				<p>
					My work starts with knowing all about the ability of the
					software, which requires hours of meetings with the PM and
					the two veterans of the product who know a lot about this
					product. Familiarizing myself with the terms, knowledge of
					how it works and creating a user flow of the app.
				</p>
				<p>
					My PM and I have made a plan to update the design of the
					widget management system, which is the core of the app and
					involves managing algorithms that drive the widgets. We will
					test the solution with some users and I will provide a
					prototype to the developers based on the Optimizely design
					system.
				</p>
				<p>
					However this was new to me as well since I joined as a part
					of the accusation of the Welcome company, Iâ€™ve never worked
					on this design system hands on.
				</p>
				<h3 id="design">Design & Testing</h3>
				<p>
					Throughout this process, I created three versions of
					prototypes. After developing the first prototype, I
					presented it to the larger team to gather usability and
					design system feedback from more experienced designers in
					the company, which informed my second iteration.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the second iteration, we aimed to conduct unmoderated
					tests. I collaborated with our research team to recruit
					users for feedback, which was the most challenging part.
					Eventually, we found participants and ran the tests. The
					overall feedback was positive, with some suggestions for
					improvement.
				</p>
				<p>
					While we waited for the test results, our developers
					continued working on the backend and some frontend
					components. During this time, we identified some issues,
					leading me to design the third version with minor changes
					and additional detailed designs for the developers.
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, we began building from the design for the Alpha
					release. Here is the Figma animation of the solution.
