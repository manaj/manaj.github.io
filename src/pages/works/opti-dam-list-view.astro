				<h1>Optimizely DAM list view design</h1>
				<h2 class="subheading">
					Enhanced the list view to display more content and added new
					features.
				</h2>
				<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Our digital asset management system, Library, had a basic
					list view with a table displaying assets, which hadn't been
					updated in years. With our new design, we initially believed
					users would prefer the redesigned category view. However,
					some clients with extensive asset libraries preferred the
					list view.

				<h3 id="roles-and-process">Roles &Â Process</h3>
				<p>
					Like previous work, I lead the design effort for the DAM
					team. We are an agile team consisting of 4/5 developers, one
					product manager, and one designer.
				</p>
				<p>
					In our organization, all designers meet weekly to discuss
					design problems. We have a couple of small teams for each
					product area, all product manager and designer meet weekly
					to discuss dependency or review of new features.
				</p>
				<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
				<p>
					We conducted competitor analysis and discovered that most
					DAM solutions present assets similarly. Conversations with
					clients revealed that those preferring the list view also
					wanted to see the folder structure.
				</p>

				<h3 id="design">Design & Testing</h3>
				<p>
					When presenting the initial designs to developers, concerns
					arose about the viewable folder structure, especially for
					clients with thousands of files, which could impact
					performance. I devised the following solution to address
					this.
				</p>
				<p>
					We haven't run any tests for this project yet, but we plan
					to interview some of our users to gather feedback on their
					experience.
