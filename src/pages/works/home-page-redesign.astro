				<h1>DAM redesign</h1>
				<h2 class="subheading">
We wanted to design a fresh new home page where people can find the content they need more easily, visually looks better yet the page looks familiar. Also, create a solid foundation for future improvements. 

				</h2>
				<h3 id="overview">
					Overview
				</h3>
				<p>
Users struggle to easily find the assets they want to use and quickly check assets to use them on and off-platform (emailing, Teams, etc to request assets). As well as they want to see the folder’s content without opening it. 
				</p>
				<figure>

				</figure>
				<p>
					We are increasing users in DAM (Digital Assets Management), so navigating through folders is a painful experience since folders once created and if the filters are set to the newest assets on the top get lost. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Lastly, we needed a wow factor for the marketing team’s demos since those are a big part of the uses of DAM
				</p>
				
				<h3 id="roles-and-process">
					Roles & Process
				</h3>
				<p>
Like previous work, I lead the design effort for the DAM team. We are an agile team consisting of 4/5 developers, one product manager, and one designer. That’s our development team.
				</p>
				<p>
In our organization, all designers meet weekly to discuss design problems. We have a couple of small teams based on the product we also meet every other day to discuss our problems and solution				</p>
				<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
				<p>
We looked into the various competitor’s products, as well as some b2c applications. Most importantly we talked to users about how they want to see the product in the future. Most of these meetings are with an account manager, product manager, and some cases me as well. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the features e.g. folder preview were a long-wanted feature which we get feedback from our sales team often before. Also given our search ability wasn’t great so having a categorical list made sense. This also allows us to add different sections for different kinds of clients e.g. recently created section.

				</p>
				<p>
					Our assets cards also were old, we needed to change that as well. For that, we tried preference tests as well as some parts of the design when we were creating it which I will explain in a bit. 
				</p>
				<h3 id="solution">
					Solution
				</h3>
				<p>
As we decided about the category-based organization, we took the opportunity to test some of our assumptions.
				</p>
				
<p>
First, we run some preference tests in usabilityhub.com  for some of the small things like our card, icon placement, folder preview, image card, etc. After around 9 tests we could get an idea about what our cards might look like. So we started with that. 
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="/images/preference-test.png" alt="Image of preference tests" />
					<figcaption>Screenshot of preference tests</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
Along the way, we also created some of the screens as how we thought our categorical view might look like. So we finalized those views with winning cards in the preference test. Now the next step would be to test some of the merged layouts. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
We first tested folder preview since we wanted to make this right, and since some users wanted to have this feature, it would be nice to test among them.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="/images/folder-test.png" alt="Image of preference tests" />
					<figcaption>Folder Preference Test</figcaption>
				</figure>
<p>
We couldn't use usabilityhub for that. To address this, we explored an alternative approach. Since we were already utilizing Gainsight for user messaging and obtaining user information, leveraging its capability to target specific user segments seemed appealing. However, a significant obstacle was that Gainsight is not designed as testing software. Despite this limitation, we devised a workaround by repurposing its multiple-question survey to align with our needs.
</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="/images/preference-test-Gainsight.png" alt="Image of preference tests" />
					<figcaption>Folder Preference Test</figcaption>
				</figure>
<p>
Usually it’s used to test things like how happy with our software. We made it such a way so it only has two options rather than five and people can also comment on the reason of choosing there answer. We targeted only library users so people jumped in to vote as well as spend some time and wrote comments. 
				</p>
				<figure>

					<figcaption>Folder Preference Test</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					The test had 3 parts we needed to check, how to they like the search to behave, how the basic card should look like and finally the one previously described. People gave us feedback in our surprise people choose the folder preview I personally didn’t like but thats the beauty of testing I guess. 

				</p>
				<p>Finally we have a design for MVP. </p>
