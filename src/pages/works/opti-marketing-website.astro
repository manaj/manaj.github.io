				<h1>Optimizely CMS marketing website redesign</h1>
				<h2 class="subheading">
					The CMS marketing website required a redesign, so I explored
					various design options for the page. While my primary focus
					is on product design, I took on this project as an
					experiment to apply my skills to a marketing website.

				<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
				<p>
					Since this was a personal project, I couldn't follow a
					full-fledged design process. However, I adhered to a
					fundamental design methodology:
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Heuristic Evaluation</dt>
					<dd>
						I conducted a quick review of the existing website to
						identify UX and design issues.
					</dd>
					<dt>Competitor Research</dt>
					<dd>
						Using Gartner, I analyzed similar competitors, such as
						Contentful and Adobe Experience Manager, to gather
						design inspiration and best practices.
					</dd>

					<dt>Page Designs</dt>
					<dd>
						I created multiple design options for the webpage,
						preparing them for potential peer review.
					</dd>
					<dt>Peer Review</dt>
					<dd>
						Typically, I would present the designs to my peers for
						feedback and refinement. However, this step was optional
						for this project.
					</dd>
					<dt>A/B test</dt>
					<dd>
						In a real-world scenario, once the development phase is
						complete, A/B testing would be conducted to determine
						which design performs best.
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<h5>Heuristics evaluation</h5>
				<p>
					I reviewed the previous website and documented my
					evaluations and recommendations in a spreadsheet.
				</p>

					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h5>Competitor Research</h5>
				<p>
					For research, I explored competitor websites via Gartner. I
					identified key players in the industry, such as Contentful
					and Adobe Experience Manager, and took screenshots of their
					designs to analyze trends. Some key findings included:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						"Capabilities" or "Benefits" sections vary in
						presentation: some use long lists similar to ours, while
						others incorporate columns, accordions, or tabs. One
						competitor even uses scroll-jacking.
					</li>
					<li>
						Several websites highlight key points by using
						brand-colored text.
					</li>
					<li>
						Background choices differ: five websites use white, two
						use black, and one uses blue.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Page Design Options</h5>
				<p class="no-bottom-space">
					Based on my research, I developed four distinct design
					concepts:
				</p>
				<ul class="no-list horizontal-list">
					<li>
						<figure>
							<a
								target="_blank"
								href="/images/works/opti-marketing-website/design1.png"
							>
								<img
									src="/images/works/opti-marketing-website/design1_thumbnail.png"
									alt="Design option 1"
								/>
							</a>
							<figcaption>Design option 1</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Introduced navy blue, a brand color, to create a
								more professional feel compared to the current
								black theme.
							</li>
							<li>Used a single hero image for clarity.</li>
							<li>
								Designed the "Capabilities" section with a
								three-column layout.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<figure>
							<a
								target="_blank"
								href="/images/works/opti-marketing-website/design2.png"
							>
								<img
									src="/images/works/opti-marketing-website/design2_thumbnail.png"
									alt="Design option 2"
								/>
							</a>
							<figcaption>Design option 2</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Incorporated a hero video instead of a static
								image.
							</li>
							<li>
								Introduced a tabbed view for the "Capabilities"
								section, allowing users to focus on one item at
								a time.
							</li>
							<li>
								Proposed a one-minute hero video explaining the
								product in detail.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<figure>
							<a
								target="_blank"
								href="/images/works/opti-marketing-website/design3.png"
							>
								<img
									src="/images/works/opti-marketing-website/design3_thumbnail.png"
									alt="Design option 3"
								/>
							</a>
							<figcaption>Design option 3</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Used a gradient background with lighter tones
								for a modern look.
							</li>
							<li>
								Leveraged large fonts and a single-column layout
								for the hero section.
							</li>
							<li>
								Designed a vertical tab or accordion layout for
								the "Capabilities" section, which could function
								as an automatic slideshow.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<figure>
							<a
								target="_blank"
								href="/images/works/opti-marketing-website/design1.png"
							>
								<img
									src="/images/works/opti-marketing-website/design4_thumbnail.png"
									alt="Design option 4"
								/></a
							>
							<figcaption>Design option 4</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Maintained the existing designâ€™s core structure
								but refined it for a lighter feel.
							</li>
							<li>
								Created a split-layout hero section with a video
								positioned at the bottom.
							</li>
							<li>
								Implemented a free-flowing list in the
								"Capabilities" section for better adaptability.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Other Steps</h5>
				<p>
					Since I was not going to push it to production I didn't have
					to do the stems peer review and A/B testing. However in any
					production site I would do those steps and then finalize
					one.
