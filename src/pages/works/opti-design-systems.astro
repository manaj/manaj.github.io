				<h1>Design system</h1>
				<h2 class="subheading">
					The challenge was to create a reference system for all
					designers, featuring a set of reusable design elements.
				</h2>
				<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
				<p>
					NewsCred had an early version of a design system. Since
					then, we have used three design systems and are now in the
					process of merging them with the Optimizely Design System,
					updating both to newer versions.
				</p>

				<h3 id="roles-and-process">Role and the Team</h3>
				<p>
					During the NewsCred and Welcome era, the design system
					lacked a dedicated designer. Instead, three designers
					collectively managed the design system, with anyone able to
					propose new components or updates. After Welcome's merger
					with Optimizely, we began integrating our design system with
					theirs and are now creating a unified, updated version.
				</p>

				<h3 id="badge">Badge Design</h3>
				<p>
					Badges varied across products, leading to user confusion
					when multiple designs were enabled. My goal was to
					standardize badges to a singular design.
				</p>

				<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
				<p>
					To start with I started collecting all the types of badges
					we use in different products across Optimizely. To get
					inspiration from other products Iâ€™ve also collected and
					reviewed major design systems. This helps me to form some
					opinions on Badges.
				</p>

				<h3 id="test">Test</h3>
				<p>
					Then I designed several types of badges using accessible
					colors (AA) and conducted a vote among all designers,
					selecting three finalists for a user preference test.
